R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.1.1 and R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

I have read and agree to the the CRAN policies at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html.

This push fixes description of the package in the DESCRIPTION file, changes \dontrun to \donttest, and adds more instructions on obtaining and using an API key for Enigma. 

The name of the package is enigma, all lowercase, while the name of the company to which this package interacts with is Enigma, uppercase "E". I asked them if they were okay with this R package name, and they were okay with the name.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
