Title: Client for the 'Enigma' 'API'
Description: The company 'Enigma' (https://enigma.io) holds many public 'datasets' from
    governments, companies, universities, and organizations. 'Enigma' provides an
    'API' for data, 'metadata', and statistics on each of the 'datasets'. 'enigma' is
    a client to interact with the 'Enigma' 'API', including getting the data
    and 'metadata' for 'datasets' in 'Enigma', as well as collecting statistics on
    'datasets'. In addition, you can download a 'gzipped' 'csv' file of a 'dataset'
    if you want the whole 'dataset'. An 'API' key from 'Enigma' is required to use
    'enigma'.
